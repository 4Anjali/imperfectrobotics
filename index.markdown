Currently we are focused on building a carrot sorting robotic workcell.
# Current Status:
## Camera integrated with robotic arm
## Machine Vision model correctly detecting good, bad, imperfect carrots
## Robotic arm moving to correct bins based on classification

# To Do:
## Make end of gripper work for carrots
## Figure out way for 360 degree view of carrots (use multiple cameras?)
##

# Looking For:
## Mechanism Design Experts
## Volunteers to label carrots into correct categories
## Farm partners
