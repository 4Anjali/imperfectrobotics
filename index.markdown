### Completed:
- Robot installed for prototyping
- Vacumm End of Arm tool integrated
- Air Compressor Integrated with Vacumm EoAT
- Camera integrated with robotic arm
- Produce images acquired, pre-processed and labeled
- Machine vision algorithm trained for detecting good, bad, imperfect carrots
- Robot programmed
- Robotic arm moving to correct bins based on classification
- Robotic workcell assembled

### Work In Process Tasks:
- Make gripper work for carrots
- Figure out way for 360 degree view of carrots (use multiple cameras?)
- Improve accuracy of object detection algorithm under varying light conditions

### Future Work:
- Scale to more produce items
- Collaborate with local farms
- Collaborate with interested firms
