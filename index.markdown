Currently we are focused on building a carrot sorting robotic workcell.
Our goal is to be able to collect and serve fresh produce for the people of Detroit.
Specific goal: serve at least 5000 boxes of fresh produce by Thanksgiving 2024.
Below is a quick recap of where we are at rn.

## Current Status:
- Camera integrated with robotic arm
- Machine Vision model correctly detecting good, bad, imperfect carrots
- Robotic arm moving to correct bins based on classification

## To Do:
- Make end of gripper work for carrots
- Figure out way for 360 degree view of carrots (use multiple cameras?)

## Looking For:
- Mechanism Design Experts
- Volunteers to label carrots into correct categories
- Farm partners
