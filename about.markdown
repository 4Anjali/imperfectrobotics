### Why
In the face of the impending challenge of feeding a growing global population, one-third of all food produced ends up as waste.
A notable contributor to this problem is the wastage of a third of perfectly edible and nutritious fresh produce because they do not meet the high cosmetic standards expected by consumers.
Eliminating this wastage of imperfect produce is therefore a crucial and sustainable means to increase food supply for a growing global population.
This can be achieved through automated sorting of good, bad and imperfect produce using automation , robotics and machine vision. 

### What
This project is aimed at developing a machine vision enabled robotic work cell for sorting and saving imperfect produce.
Given our location in Detroit, we starting with a pilot project to serve fresh produce in the city of Detroit, which is an unqualified food dessert. Our specific and measurable goals are:
- Create a fully functioning robotic sorter for carrots and strawberries
- Partner with at least 5 local farms
- Serve at least 5,000 boxes of fresh produce in Detroit by Thanksgiving (11/28/24)
- Develop a sustainbale and viable distribution system in Detorit to eliminate food dessert zones
