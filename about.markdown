### Why
In the face of the impending challenge of feeding a growing global population, one-third of all food produced ends up as waste.
A notable contributor to this problem is the wastage of a third of perfectly edible and nutritious fresh produce because they do not meet the high cosmetic standards expected by consumers.
Eliminating this wastage of imperfect produce is therefore a crucial and sustainable means to increase food supply for a growing global population.
This can be achieved through automated sorting of good, bad and imperfect produce using automation , robotics and machine vision. 

### What
This project is aimed at developing a machine vision enabled robotic work cell for sorting and saving imperfect produce.

### Project#01: Serve Fresh Produce in Detroit
Detroit is a food dessert. Significant parts of Detroit do not have access to fresh produce. As a first pilot, we intend to serve upto 5,000 boxes of fresh produce by 2024 Thanksgiving.
Our goal is to build a sustainable ecosystem of affordable fresh produce reaching its citizens.
